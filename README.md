Create three different API endpoints, Magic 8 Ball, Guess it, and Restauraunt picker, and connect them to controllers.

Peer Review: Jayvon Khuth - I was able to run all of the endpoints on postman and swagger, and was able to get all the correct outputs. However one thing that I would recommend adding is another validation for the guess it endpoints, so that when a user inputs a number higher than the number range, it will tell them to input a number within the correct number range. You can do this by just adding another if statement where it checks if the number is higher than 0 but less than the number cap. Also for the restaurant picker, I think it needs to require an input, but without that, all of the endpoints for it works very well. I liked how the logical code in the service's files were very simple and concise, this makes the code easy to read and understand. Good Job! Keep up the good work.
